users.controllers.js - login

// IF, a user w/ 60 char bcrypt hash of plaintext PW 
   // could be inserted into the users DB, to pass the bcrypt comparison
   // would a token be issued for that username?  
   // The answer here is YES, YES, YES.
   
   Overall the app and DB would have to be pretty unsecure, but someone inside the FW could do this
   
   // first gain root access to the application and 
   // via the app Register a user with PW == "whatever"
   // then gain access to the MongoDB directory instance 
   // Create a new user json object for mongoimport 
   // use the "whatever" hash value from the registered user in the new user object
   // mongoimport the new user.json to the users collection
   // login to the app as new user with "whatever" as PW
   // a token will be issued to the new user ID
   
   
   // What if and unsecured public facing MongoDB upserted a new root admin json?
   // e.g. on a new instance of Bitnami or Strongloop MEAN stack
